IT410 user management system assignment. Functionality only, no web interface

###Objective:
Implement a system where users can login, logout, and update basic profile information.
The system must also be able to keep track of who is logged in.
Write your own tests to verify that the system works as expected.

###Assignment:
Your user management system should implement each of the following pieces of functionality in addition to what is needed by your project:

* create a user
* update a user's password
* authenticate a user with password

###Use unit tests to validate the functionality of the system. For example:
* Test that a user can be created.
* Test that two users with the same name cannot be created.
* Test that a user can change their password.
* Test that a correct username and password passes the authentication check.
* Test that an incorrect username and password does not pass the authentication check.
