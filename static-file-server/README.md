# static-file-server

This assignment consists of multiple parts:

1.  Get your project directory structure in order. (More details on this below.)
2.  Configure package.json so that running npm start will start your application and npm test will run all of your tests.
3.  Starting your application should accept one argument that allows the person starting your application to specify the root     directory for the files to be served. If one is not specified then the current working directory (the directory the start     command was called from) should be used.
4.  Once the application is started it must output to the console the port number that the server is listening on.
5.  The running application should serve files via HTTP.
